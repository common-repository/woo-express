Simplifies the checkout process to improve your sales rate.

== Description ==

[WooCommerce Express](https://wp.rocks/woocommerce-express/) allows you to simplifies the checkout process by skipping the shopping cart page. The “Add to cart” button is added in each product to redirect customers to the checkout page. This can encourage buyers to shop more and quickly process the transaction, which can lead to a possible increase in sales.

== Ajax add to cart ==

The Ajax add to cart option allows you to include single products, variable, grouped and virtual products in the cart without the need to reload the entire site each time.

== Fastest checkout ==

The checkout options allow you to easily remove the unnecessary fields to reduce the user spend completing those fields. Also WooCommerce Express allows you to remove other unnecessary things in the checkout process like the order comments, shipping address, coupon form, policy text, and terms and conditions.

== One Page Checkout ==

In the premium version of WooCommerce Express, we've included an incredible feature that includes a cart form in the checkout. This allows your users to edit the cart items directly in the checkout page, avoiding the need to force them to edit the order in the cart page.

== Improvements ==

1. Use less bandwidth
2. Reduce server load
3. Speed user experience
4. Increase your sales!
